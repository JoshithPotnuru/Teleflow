# 🤖 teleflow

> **Your intelligent, human-like Telegram Userbot powered by LLMs.**  
> *Seamlessly integrated, context-aware, and strictly secure.*

**teleflow** is a powerful Userbot that connects your Telegram account to Gemini. It acts on your behalf, allowing you to reply to messages using AI with deep context awareness, while maintaining your personal style and privacy.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Deep Context Awareness**: Replies are not isolated! The bot reads the **entire reply chain** (history, sender names, timestamps) to understand the full conversation context.
- **🗣️ Human Mode**: responses are formatted like a real human (no formal punctuation, casual tone).
- **🎭 Custom Persona**: Acts as **Marcel** (or your custom identity) — a nationalist, programmer, and critical thinker.
- **👻 Ghost Mode**:
    - **Auto-Delete**: The `!ask` command is instantly deleted.
    - **Direct Reply**: The AI response is sent as a new message from *you*.
- **⚡ Smart Input**:
    - Give instructions: `!ask Roast him` -> The AI roasts the target.
    - Draft replies: `!ask I disagree` -> The AI writes a full argument based on your stance.
    - **Auto-Participate**: Reply with just `!ask` (no text) to let the AI join the conversation naturally.
- **🔒 Secure & Private**:
    - **Strict ID Check**: Only responds to commands from the `OWNER_ID`.
    - **Error Privacy**: Errors are logged to the terminal, not the chat.
